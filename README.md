# States
Code that I created using newly learned nodes
Basic List of States and some values to them while including the memory address that they are currently at as well as the address they are pointing to
to make sure that the nodes are connected well.


Has multiple options:
1) Insert a new node to the beginning of the list
2) Insert a new node to the end of the list
3) Insert a new node into the middle of the list
4) Display all nodes in list from first to last
5) Display all nodes in list from last to first
6) Search for a node by state name
7) Search for a node by state name and be able to make changes to that node
8) Delete a node by state name
9) A way to quit the loop
